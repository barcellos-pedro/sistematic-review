You will be provided with a html page source code.
I am only interested in the content/value from it and not some code snippet.

The html page will be about a scientific research.
Search the code for the research title and the abstract/description.

If you cannot parse the title or the abstract, fill the columns with an empty string.
If the page is a PDF, fill the title column with the respective title
and the abstract column with 'PDF' value.

I want the result output to be in a CSV format, the headers are: title and abstract.
For every row, end with a comma.
Leave only one trailing newline after the last row.
